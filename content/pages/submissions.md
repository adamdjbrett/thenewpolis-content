*The New Polis* welcomes submissions both of a scholarly and popular nature that fit within its broad range in topic areas from critical theory and cultural analysis to political thought and theology.

Scholarly articles will be refereed and, if accepted, published in [*The New Polis* journal](https://journal.thenewpolis.com).

We welcome all areas of expertise in the arts and humanities.  We do not publish social scientific articles with quantitative analysis unless the data merely occasionally supplements through graphs or charts what is basically a qualitative narrative.

All submissions are carefully vetted by its editorial staff, who have advanced academic degrees.  Occasional articles – e.g., reviews, essays, interviews, reflections, editorials, opinion pieces – are reviewed by the senior editors for our [ejournal](/) and may be selected for publication in the [academic journal](https://journal.thenewpolis.com) within two years following initial appearance.
