**The conference is free to all attendees**, **although donations (which can be made through [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/decoloniality-and-disintegration-of-western-cognitive-empire-conference-tickets-147444830457)) are welcome.** *[Please click on “Tickets” at the top of the page at Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/decoloniality-and-disintegration-of-western-cognitive-empire-conference-tickets-147444830457)* [site for the conference](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/decoloniality-and-disintegration-of-western-cognitive-empire-conference-tickets-147444830457). Donations will go to the Whitestone Foundation to cover incidental conference expenses. All donations beyond that amount will be donated by The Whitestone Foundation specifically to the [Tink Tinker Program Endowment Fund](https://www.iliff.edu/tinker/).

**In order to take part in the conference, however,** [**you must first register**](https://udenver.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZItdu-oqDgjGtARFSnxe2mf7ezdk9J1psKS). Once you register, you will automatically receive a participation link for Zoom, which will be valid for the entire conference.

## An English-Spanish translator will be available for certain sessions.

*We are excited about this distinctive event, and even more gratified that we have had significantly more attendees register than anticipated.   However, the high volume of registrations means that it is possible some of the sessions will exceed the carrying capacity of the Zoom system.  Because it is unlikely that everyone who signed up will attend every session, this possibility could probably apply to only some of the more popular sessions.  But if we have to restrict attendees at any given session through the Zoom registration link, we wanted to let you know that we then activate the YouTube Livestream, and* ***you will be able to watch and post comments or questions at the following link instead:*  [*https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHaPvhNA1x8Fjry-w3lrqJw*](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHaPvhNA1x8Fjry-w3lrqJw)*.*** *Please keep this livestream link as a backup. Thank you for your understanding, and we look forward immensely to your participation.*

The conference brings together in an online webinar format scholars from around the globe to discuss what is meant by such increasingly familiar terms as “decoloniality” or “decolonization.” It will explore the relationship between these themes and issues of nationality, territoriality, and sovereignty as they concern the struggles of indigenous peoples.

As premier global theorists such as Walter Mignolo, Catherine Walsh, and Tink Tinker (all of whom will take part in the conference) have emphasized, decolonization is not simply a political and cultural matter. It is also a profound *epistemic* problem, insofar as it is the minds along with the lands of native peoples who have been colonized. Increasingly the 21st century has come to be marked by the slow disintegration of what Portuguese theorist Boaventura de Sousa Santos dubs the “cognitive empire” of Western thought that has been the drive epistemic force behind global neoliberalism.

Recent civil unrest in the United States occurs amid broader global conditions. Calls for the removals of statues and land acknowledgment for Indigenous Peoples have drawn public attention to the ways that colonial concepts such as “discovery” of a “new world” continue to underwrite laws and civic comportment. As challenges to civic rituals arise, many cannot always tell the difference between birth pangs and death groans of various social movements.

Mignolo has characterized at least part of the angst at work in current cultural conflicts as contemporaneous to the disintegration of expectations created by narratives of modernity as one project. With attendance to the pluriversality of the twenty-first century, we are better able to the inherent hubris of Western dialectics of freedom and subjectivity in tension with aspirations to empire. We are also able to account for a certain narcissism that attempts to put the drama of that western hubris onto a global “center stage” as it enacts erasures of its others.

The western notion of sovereignty, which has been central to the concerns of eurochristian political theology, signifies an attachment to a cognitive empire.

Thus, for European romantics, a distinction between “natural man” and “citizen” erases nature as it civilizes and domesticates it. Yet, from a perspective of decoloniality, such a dichotomy between these two characters performs only the androcentrism typical of humanism. While thinkers such as Michel Foucault have articulated tensions between ‘sovereign power’ and ‘disciplinary power’, it is also clear that Indigenous Peoples, for example, have not traditionally employed such extractive notions of either concept.

Rather, such notions were conceptually superimposed onto Indigenous Peoples, resulting in their perceived erasure through the conversion of ‘the world’ into a global capitalist economy through doctrines of discovery and domination.

As Taiaiake Alfred (Kahnawake Mohawk) among others have noted, colonial notions remain embedded in aspirations to “tribal sovereignty.” Even successful attempts at recognition, such as the United Nation’s Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples remains, as Ward Churchill and Charmaine White Face (Lakota) have argued, dilute the legal language and make it difficult for substantive effects in relation to centuries of injustices**.**
