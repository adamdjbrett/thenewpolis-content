A “critical conversation” between Victor E. Taylor with Walter Mignolo on his book co-authored with Catherine E. Walsh entitled [](https://www.google.com/books/edition/On_Decoloniality/l8hcDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=mignolo+on+decoloniality&printsec=frontcover)*[On Decoloniality: Concepts, Analytics, Praxis](https://www.google.com/books/edition/On_Decoloniality/l8hcDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=mignolo+on+decoloniality&printsec=frontcover)*. As Mignolo observes, decoloniality is a way to fundamentally (re)situate and reconfigure how human beings are being “ruled.” Decolonizing-work is an examination and confrontation of power alongside and before coloniality—the material conditions for invasion and control. Decolonizing-work and decoloniality are also a way of imagining, a process of creatively shaping a world-future that holds the possibility of an existence radically unaligned with Western systems of epistemological, political, and theological hegemony. The decolonial imaginary gives us a perspective on these possibilities and the material conditions required to bring them more fully to life in the arts, literature, and politics.

Prof. Mignolo is a world-famous scholar who has been the key architect and ongoing inspiration for the current interdisciplinary, far-reaching movement in the humanities known as “decolonization” or “decoloniality.”   He is Professor Emeritus of the Humanities at Duke University.
