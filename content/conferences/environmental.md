**Catherine Keller** practices theology as a relation between ancient hints of ultimacy and current matters of urgency. As the George T. Cobb Professor of Constructive Theology in the Theological School and Graduate Division of Religion of Drew University, she teaches courses in process, political, and ecological theology. Within and beyond Christian conversation, she has all along mobilized the transdisciplinary potential of feminist, philosophical, and pluralist intersections with religion.

Her most recent books invite at once contemplative and social embodiments of our entangled difference: *Facing Apocalypse: Climate, Democracy, and Other Last Chances *(Forthcoming April 2021); *Political Theology of the Earth: Our Planetary Emergency and the Struggle for a New Public *(2018); *Intercarnations: On the Possibility of Theology *(2017); and *Cloud of the Impossible: Negative Theology and Planetary Entanglement* (2014). Keller's other books include *On the Mystery: Discerning Divinity in Process *(2008); *God and Power: Counter-Apocalyptic Journeys *(2005); *Face of the Deep: A Theology of Becoming *(2003); *Apocalypse Now and Then: A Feminist Guide to the End of the World *(1996); and *From a Broken Web: Separation, Sexism, and Self *(1986).

**Description**

The concept of "environmental justice" is a relatively recent addition to the discourses of religious and political theory.  [According to the Office of Legacy Management with the Department of Energy](https://www.energy.gov/lm/what-environmental-justice#:~:text=Environmental%20justice%20is%20the%20fair,laws%2C%20regulations%2C%20and%20policies.), environmental justice can be defined as "the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people, regardless of race, color, national origin, or income, with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies." 

However, such laws are not *sui generis*, but have been elaborated in relatively recent times to long-standing spiritual attitudes and value propositions concerning what ought to be the human relationship to, and the character of our collective responsibility for, the natural order.  Virtually all of the world's historical as well as indigenous religious traditions harbor both implicit and explicit views about how human and non-human beings should cohabit as well as interact with each other. 

The overriding question for the conference is *in what specific ways do these traditions both inform and compel specific policies as well as ethical practices that constitute the spectrum of social action that counts as "environmental justice".*

**Keynote address**

Catherine Keller, Drew University

"Earth Matters:   Generation, Motivation, Eco-civilization"

The very matter of our earthbound lives is ever more at stake. Ecological solidarity recognizes the asymmetrical responsibility of the generations: those will suffer most have done least to cause the crisis.  Motivation for ecological transformation must cross that difference---and so materialize the shared future of our common home.  Motives unfold through a resilient interaction of bodies, stories, facts, ethics, grief, anger, humor and beauty. To the shadowed hope of ecocivilization, might philosophy contribute an earthbound socio-cosmology?
