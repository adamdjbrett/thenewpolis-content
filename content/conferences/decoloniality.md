Decoloniality And Disintegration Of Western Cognitive Empire -- Rethinking Sovereignty And Territoriality In The 21st Century
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**April 14-16, 2021**
---------------------

**International Online Conference**
-----------------------------------

#### **[Bios](/docs/Bios.pdf) | [Abstracts](/docs/Abstracts.pdf)**

*Sponsored by *[*The New Polis*](/)*, Whitestone Publications, and Metropolitan State University of Denver* *in collaboration with members of the Iliff School of Theology and University of Denver* *communities.*

*The program and video recordings can be found below.*

**The conference brought together in an online webinar format scholars from around the globe to discuss what is meant by such increasingly familiar terms as "decoloniality" or "decolonization." It will explore the relationship between these themes and issues of nationality, territoriality, and sovereignty as they concern the struggles of indigenous peoples.**

**As premier global theorists such as Walter Mignolo, Catherine Walsh, and Tink Tinker (all of whom will take part in the conference) have emphasized, decolonization is not simply a political and cultural matter. It is also a profound *****epistemic***** problem, insofar as it is the minds along with the lands of native peoples who have been colonized. Increasingly the 21st century has come to be marked by the slow disintegration of what Portuguese theorist Boaventura de Sousa Santos dubs the "cognitive empire" of Western thought that has been the drive epistemic force behind global neoliberalism.**
